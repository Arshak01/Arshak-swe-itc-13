If you do not know what is "CMake" just close this page or call someone who knows 😃️

for those who are enlightened
1. just move the "CMake" folder to a convenient place for you (e.g home/username/test)
2. open termiinal and go to that directory
3. use command "cmake ." (if you get an error. just google it ))))
4. use command "make" after that you will get executable file.
5. just use command " ./filename".
