## Task 1

Create some random subdirectories (e.g a, a->b, a->c, c->d, d->e) and Makefile in each folder,
which creates object files for each directory and using the Makefile in the parent(a) folder 
calls the Makefiles from the subdirectories and creates the executable file.

**Description**
*I've tried to solve the task both with the basic example and with simple calculaor.*
