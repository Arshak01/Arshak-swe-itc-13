# Program to search files or directories

**My program consists of 1 file:**

	* search.py (Main program)

**This is how I solved the problem**

	*I implemented only -p, -f, -d commands*

***To use the program***

Write the following commad in terminal from the current directery

	◦python3 search.py -f <filename> -d <directory name> -p <path>

Hope you enjoy my programs (^_^)
