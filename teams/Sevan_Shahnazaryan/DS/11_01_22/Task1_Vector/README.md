***Welcome to Vector implementation, using Cmake as a builder***

The program consists of 4 files.
1. Task1_Vector.cpp(Main program cpp file)
2. Vector.hpp(Vector class header, declarations)
3. Vector.cpp(Vector class function prototypes)
4. CMakeLists.txt(Cmake file)
5. README.md (You're here)

To build and run the program go through these following commands.
	● mkdir build (create a build directory)
	● cd build (Enter the build directory)
	● cmake .. . (Generete Makefile)
	● make (Build the program)
	● ./Vector (Run the program, named Vector)


That's all!
Hope you enjoy my program (^_^)
