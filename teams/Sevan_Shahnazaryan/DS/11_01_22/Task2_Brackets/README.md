***Welcome to Bracket checker, working on stack base***

This program checks if the brackets of the "code" are correct or not.

To build and run it:

	● mkdir build ()
	● cd build
	● cmake .. .
	● make
	● ./Brackets

In this program I used my own imlementation of Stack, modified specifically for this program.
Besides that I have all the classes and functions in header files, so my program would look simple.

Here is the file list that my program uses(8 files)

● Task2_Brackets.cpp
● Node.hpp, Node.cpp
● Stack.hpp, Stack.cpp
● cfunc.hpp, cfunc.cpp
● CMakeLists.txt

Hope you enjoy my programs (^_^)
