# My implementation of Binary Search Tree

**My program consists of 6 files:**

	* CmakeLists.txt(Minimum required version 3.10)
	* Task1_BST.cpp (main function is here)
	* Node.cpp, Node.hpp (Node class)
	* BST.cpp, BST.hpp (BST class)

**I made the following functions for BST**

	* Search(data)
	* Insert(data)
	* Print()

The remove() function is not done.

My program also keeps track on the height of the tree during Insertion.

***To use the program***

Write the following commads in terminal from the current directery

	◦mkdir build
	◦cd build
	◦cmake .. .
	◦make
	◦./BST

Hope you enjoy my programs (^_^)
