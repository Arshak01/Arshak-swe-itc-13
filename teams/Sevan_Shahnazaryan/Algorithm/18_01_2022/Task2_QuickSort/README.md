# My implementation of Quick sort

**My program consists of 4 files:**

	* CmakeLists.txt(Minimum required version 3.10)
	* Main.cpp (main function is here)
	* QUick.cpp, Quick.hpp (Quick Sort namespace)

**I made the following functions for SelSort**

	* print(arr, size) *prints the array*
	* randomGen(size) *Generetes an array with give size*
	* sort(arr, size) *Devides and sorts the array by comparing with pivot*
	* merge(int arr1, int arr2, int size1, int size2, int pivot) *Merges 2 arrays and the pivot*

***To use the program***

Write the following commads in terminal from the current directery

	◦mkdir build
	◦cd build
	◦cmake .. .
	◦make
	◦./QuickSort

Hope you enjoy my programs (^_^)
