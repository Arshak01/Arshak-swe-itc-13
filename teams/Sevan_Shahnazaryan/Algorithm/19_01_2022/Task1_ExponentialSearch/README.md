# My implementation of Exponential search

**My program consists of 4 files:**

	* CmakeLists.txt(Minimum required version 3.10)
	* Main.cpp (main function is here)
	* Expo.cpp, Expo.hpp (Exponential Search namespace)

**I made the following functions for Expo**

	* print(arr, size) *prints the array*
	* arrGen(size) *Generetes a sorted array with given size*
	* BinarySearch(int arr, int size, int elem, int left, int right) *Binary search for the rest of the array*
	* search(int arr, int size, int elem) *Searches an array range by powering index by 2*

***To use the program***

Write the following commads in terminal from the current directery

	◦mkdir build
	◦cd build
	◦cmake .. .
	◦make
	◦./ExponentialSearch

Hope you enjoy my programs (^_^)
