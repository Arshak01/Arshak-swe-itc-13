###Problem 1: It is required to create a pandas DataFrame which will have 5 columns and 150 rows. The contents of the 'data' variable will be written in the first 4 columns. And in the fifth column there will be 'target', but instead of every number there will be an element with the corresponding index of 'target_names' written. The names of the first 4 columns will be the elements of 'feature_names' (in the given order), and the name of the fifth will be "target name".

###Problem 2: Find the petals of each flower (petals և petals).
   1. average length
   2. average width:
   3. minimum length
   4. minimum width:
   5. maximum length
   6. maximum width

###Problem 3: delete rows from table f whose 'sepal width' is less than the average of its type (using df_stats calculations from the previous problem). Make the change on df մի do not return anything with the function.

###Problem 4: Create a dataframe based on the variables X, y (like Problem 1.). Define the names of the descriptive columns according to the list above, and the name of the last column - "MEDV".

###Problem 5: Return the lines of the 3 "cheapest districts" where the CRIM is greater than 0.5.
