you should run "make" command from folder named "a".
rest of the makefiles will be launched automatically, and will be created needed files with .o extension,
and at the end you will get the final "main" executable file.
-----------------------------------
// from "a" foleder
make
./main

//output - 12 * 4 = 48
Thanks for attention
