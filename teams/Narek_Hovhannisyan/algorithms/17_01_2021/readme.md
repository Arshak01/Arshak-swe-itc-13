# Bubble, Insertion, Selection and Merge sort implementation application

## To build and run the application you need to run commands below from ".../Narek_Hovhannisyan/algorithms/17_01_2022/ directory

```bash
mkdir build && cd build 
cmake .. . && make && ./main
```

> the executable file is ".../build/**main**"

 To run functions one by one you can uncomment one of the lines from 22 to 25 in "main.cpp" file
 I've run each sorting function 3 times. The results are written after function calls in comment.

Fill free to use the application

### Thanks
