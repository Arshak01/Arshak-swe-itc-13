# Application to find min and max of array using divide and conquer concept

## To build and run the application you need to run commands below from ".../Narek_Hovhannisyan/algorithms/25_01_2022" directory

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. . && make && ./main
```

> the executable file is ".../build/**main**"
