Hi all.
I have implemented vector class which contains default constructor and constructor with parameters,
also void push(), void pop(), void insert(int index, int data), int size(), int capacity(),  operator[]  (int n), methods.

And I have created a program which checks if bracket combination is correct or not.
Each of them is in separate directories. 

So, for executation each programs you have to do this steps(I think that you are already in my ../Margarita_Hambaryan/DS/11_01_2022 directory):
1. go to directory you want (cd brackets or cd vector)
2. //create a directory with name build
mkdir build
3. //enter to that directory
cd build
4. //and call cmake
cmake .. .
5. //call make
make
6. //see the result
./main

Thanks, Margarita
