Hi. Hope you are doing well.
Today I have created subdirectories. Each of them has its own part of code. Together they form one unique program. In this case that program is a calculator.

So, if you want to try it you just need to create a directory and pull all files which are in my branch in it.
After that you have to create a new directory. You can call it 'build'.

And move there(cd build).
After that using these two commands (cmake .. . and make) create an executable test file.
And run it using the ./test command.

After that the program will be worked.

Thx for attention.
