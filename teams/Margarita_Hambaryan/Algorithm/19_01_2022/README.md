Hi all.
I have implemented algorithms for searching like Interpolation Search and have implemented a given graph as a matrix.

Each of them is in separate directories. 

So, for executation each programs you have to do this steps(I think that you are already in my ../Margarita_Hambaryan/Algorithm/19_01_2022 directory):
1. go to directory you want (cd interpolation or cd graph_implementation)
2. //create a directory with name build
mkdir build
3. //enter to that directory
cd build
4. //and call cmake
cmake .. .
5. //call make
make
6. //see the result
./main

Thanks, Margarita
