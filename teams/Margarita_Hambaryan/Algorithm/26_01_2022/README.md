Hi all.
I have implemented code for finding Ugly Numbers with loop and recursion using dynamic programming.

So, for executation each programs you have to do this steps(I think that you are already in my ../Margarita_Hambaryan/Algorithm/26_01_2022 directory):

1. //create a directory with name build
mkdir build
2. //enter to that directory
cd build
3. //and call cmake
cmake .. .
4. //call make
make
5. //see the result
./main

Thanks, Margarita
