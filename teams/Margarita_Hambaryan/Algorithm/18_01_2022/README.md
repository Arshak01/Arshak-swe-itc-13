Hi all.
I have implemented algorithms for sorting like shell sorting and quick sorting.

Each of them is in separate directories. 

So, for executation each programs you have to do this steps(I think that you are already in my ../Margarita_Hambaryan/DS/11_01_2022 directory):
1. go to directory you want (cd shell or cd quick)
2. //create a directory with name build
mkdir build
3. //enter to that directory
cd build
4. //and call cmake
cmake .. .
5. //call make
make
6. //see the result
./main

Thanks, Margarita
