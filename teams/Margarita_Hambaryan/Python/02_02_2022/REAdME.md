Hi all:)
Hope you are doing great.

Today Iâ€™ve created a program which counts the most common names in a text.

For input() you have only lines. Each line is a sentence.
And the problem is finding names which start with capital letters. If that name is the first word in a sentence you must check if it appeared in text before that. If yes, you add the value with one point. Also, you have to check if that word is a sentence and it is repeated, you have to add the value only with one point( for example: Tux is TUX -> value = 1).

After this, the program gets one number N. 
The program must print all names if N is greater than the count of names. Else. the program prints first N names.

Thanks, Margarita
