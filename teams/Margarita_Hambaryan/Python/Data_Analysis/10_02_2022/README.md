Hi all,
Today's homework is about:

Task 1: Return the lines of the 6 "most expensive neighborhoods" on the banks of the Charles River.

Task 2: Return the average room number (RM) երի's median house prices for the neighborhoods with the 10 most rooms on average. The result should be a 10 × 2 DataFrame sorted in descending order of the RM column.

Task 3: Add a new line in df according to the given 14 length x vector.

Task 4: Delete the first column from df.

Task 5: Using the groupby function, find the means of the characteristics of the non-located neighborhoods near the river.
