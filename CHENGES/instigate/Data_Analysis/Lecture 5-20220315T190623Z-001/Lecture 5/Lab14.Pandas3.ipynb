The associated index structure is ``PeriodIndex``.\n","- For *time deltas* or *durations*, Pandas provides the ``Timedelta`` type. ``Timedelta`` is a more efficient replacement for Python's native ``datetime.timedelta`` type, and is based on ``numpy.timedelta64``. The associated index structure is ``TimedeltaIndex``.\n","\n","The most fundamental of these date/time objects are the ``Timestamp`` and ``DatetimeIndex`` objects.\n","While these class objects can be invoked directly, it is more common to use the ``pd.to_datetime()`` function, which can parse a wide variety of formats.\n","Passing a single date to ``pd.to_datetime()`` yields a ``Timestamp``;
