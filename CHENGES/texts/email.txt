Hi all,
Please see my report for today below:
Today the following tasks have been done:

Task 1: Done
        Description: Write a function for swapping two variable values.
        The function should have been implemented for each basic data type.
                     - swap(int a, int b)// use pointer instead
                     - swap(float a, float b)// use pointer instead
                     - swap(double a, double b)// use pointer instead

Task 2: Done
        Description: Write an application that includes such functionalities.
                     - sort a static array with ascending order
                     - sort a static array with descending order
                      - revers static array
                      - print array
